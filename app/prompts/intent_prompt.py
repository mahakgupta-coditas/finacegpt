INTENT_CLASSIFICATION_PROMPT = """
You are an advanced intent classifier for FinanceGPT. Analyze the user query considering conversation context.

User Query: {user_query}
Chat History: {history}

CLASSIFICATION CATEGORIES:
1. "financial_query" - Specific financial questions requiring data/analysis
2. "greeting" - Simple greetings only
3. "out_of_scope" - Non-financial topics

ENHANCED CLASSIFICATION RULES:
- Classify follow-up questions as "financial_query" even if they seem generic
- If user previously asked about a company/topic, related questions are financial
- Questions like "exact growth", "in numbers", "tell me more" are financial when in context
- Only classify as greeting if it's purely social (Hi, Hello, How are you)

Context Awareness:
- If previous conversation was about financial topics, assume current query is related
- Questions seeking "exact numbers" or "specific data" are always financial
- Follow-up questions inherit the financial context
